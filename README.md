# John S. Nelson

I just started my first semester at Georgia Tech in the OMSCS program. My specialization will be in Interactive Intelligence. I intend to learn more about how people interact with technology, especially in regards to AI and ML systems. In my day job, I am a full-stack developer at Davey Resource Group where I work on our mobile, offline, data collection utility, ResourceKeeper. As a senior developer, I find myself working on a variety of projects, developing solutions with the best technologies for the problem at hand.

## Major Interests
* Apple devices and platforms
* Swift
* HCI
* AI
* electronic music
* digital art

When I'm not working on school or work, you can often find me in the World of Warcraft.
